### 2.	Why to use simulation instead of actual hardware systems?
  **`MENTION THE REASONS ONLY`**
   ```

   ```
### 3.	What are the best use cases for ESP32 over Arduino UNO?
  ```
  MENTION ANY THREE


  ```
### 4.	Arduino supports C/C++, why can micropython be an alternative to it and discuss the limitations. 
  ```
  MENTION THE REASONS HERE:
